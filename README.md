📚 Book Recommendation System
This project is a Book Recommendation System designed to help users discover books they might enjoy based on their preferences or popular trends. The system uses machine learning techniques such as content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to generate accurate and personalized recommendations.

🔍 Objective
The main objective of this project is to build an intelligent system that recommends books to users by analyzing user behavior, preferences, and book features like title, author, and genre.

💡 Key Features
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests books similar to those a user has liked based on book descriptions and metadata.

Collaborative Filtering: Recommends books based on user ratings and behavior patterns.

Popular Books Section: Highlights top-rated and most-read books.

Search Functionality: Allows users to search for any book title within the dataset.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language used for logic and model building.

Pandas, NumPy: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Scikit-learn: For similarity algorithms like cosine similarity and nearest neighbors.

Jupyter Notebook: For prototyping and testing the models.

Streamlit / Flask (optional): For deploying the recommendation system with a simple UI.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains book titles, authors, genres, ratings, and user interaction data. It can be sourced from platforms like Kaggle or Goodreads, and is preprocessed to remove duplicates and irrelevant data.
